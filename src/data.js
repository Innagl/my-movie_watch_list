        review: "The movie reminds us that the legacy of the Holocaust offers no clear resolution. Its trauma may be hidden beneath the surface, but it remains a wound that time cannot fully heal."

        review: "Sanders nods to Miyazaki’s colors, but the emotional depth feels manufactured. Beneath the beauty lies a hollow core. What begins with promise fades into sentimental gloss."
